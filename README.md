Welcome to another project of mine. The main idea of this project is to create a site for merchandise. Ideally it's supposed to be Anime merchandise but there are not API's for anime clothes. So do not be surprised when you see normal clothes for sale.
I have yet to put it on Vercel yet. I will only do so after I'm happy with the landing page.
Expect the development of this site to not be that quick. It's recess, I'm home. So there are these things called chores that I have to do that eat up my time plus. I"m trying to learn a backend language.

As always like kokoro. If there is something that you want me to specifically add or there's a bug. Hit me up and I'll fix it up.
